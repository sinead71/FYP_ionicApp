1.This is my read me file it contains all the infomation you need to know about this project. 

2.This project is run on a hybrid developer application called Ionic v2. 

3.How to install ionic to view the code running:
    >Open up a terminal window with in my project
    >type: npm install -g ionic cordova
    >once done in the same terminal type: cd myApp
    >then type: ionic serve
    >this will open up a web browser that will run the project. 
    >To view it similar to a phone screen size, resize the broswer window. 
        The project will adjust with it. 
    
4.The app was also exported into an .apk file to be used on an android device. 
    This can be found in the following file:
    > myApp > platforms > android > build > outputs > apk
    The file inside is the .apk file. 
    You can upload this file to your personal cloud storage.
    Then on your android device download the file and allow it to install. 
    This app runs very slowly so it may take up to 15 seconds for the log in page to load.
    However, the app did not work from there on. 

5.The app was also uploaded to my personal github page. 
    It was set up so that you could view it through Google.
    Link:  http://sinead71.github.io/myApp/src/
    Again however this only seems to show a blank page. 

6.The project files that contain the main pages are:
    Home: myApp > src > pages > Home
    Details: myApp > src > pages > Details
    NewMessage: myApp > src > pages > NewMessage
    Profile: myApp > src > pages > NewMessage
